# myFtp - Hubert Truong
## Presentation of the project
The project consists in coding a working **FTP client and server** that recognizes the commands.
## Programming languages and tools used
I used **NodeJS** and **Javascript** to code my FTP server and client. <br />
I coded on **Visual Studio Code**, then used **Github Dekstop** to push my code.
## Commands needed (Total: 9)
```USER <username>:``` Check if the user exist <br />
```PASS <password>:``` Authenticate the user with a password <br />
```LIST:``` List the current directory of the server <br />
```CWD <directory>:``` Change the current directory of the server <br />
```RETR <filename>:``` Transfer a copy of the file *FILE* from the server to the client <br />
```STOR <filename>``` Transfer a copy of the file *FILE* from the client to the server <br />
```PWD:``` Display the name of the current directory of the server <br />
```HELP:``` Send helpful information to the client <br />
```QUIT:``` Close the connection and stop the program <br />
## Commands successfully coded (Done: 7/9)
I managed to code only 7 on the 9 commands asked : 
```USER <username>```, ```PASS <password>```, ```LIST```, ```CWD <directory>```, ```PWD```, ```HELP``` and ```QUIT```.<br />
> ```RETR``` and ```STOR``` were too difficult for me to code and after trying to look for some examples on Internet, I couldn't code it because of my lack of skills.
## Notes
This project was a good initiation to FTP servers and clients, but it was really complicated at the beginning since I never used NodeJS and I'm not used to code in Javascript. I should have check videos by myself instead of only following the course.
However, I learnt a lot and understood the things I didn't in the beginning. It was a cool project to be honest. I was proud of myself after succesfully coded the commands and saw them working in my terminal. <br />
I finished my code after documentated it, by writing in which way cosists a command. I'm not sure if the documentation is long and great enough but i think it should help every developper trying to continue working on my code.
